# JadedBot
JadedBot is a simple Discord bot written in Python3+

### Install dependencies and setup
Install the dependencies with

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Open `jaded.py` with a text editor and edit `TOKEN=""` with your Discord token or the bot will not run.

If you want reddit functionality to work you will also need to set `REDDIT_ID = ""` and `REDDIT_SECRET = ""`. Search praw login for their guide on that.

### Running the bot
`$ python3 jaded.py`
