### New JadedBot
The time came for a rewrite of the bot as the code beforehand was messy and I wanted to be able to add modules into the bot as it's running. Thus we now have a new and improved JadedBot 1.5 now with modular plugins.

More indepth README and installation guide coming in the next commits to this repo.


### Installation.

#### Unix/Linux/BSD
The easiest time you'll have installing this bot is in a UNIX like environment such a Linux/BSD.

You made need sudo access for pip3 access aswell as ffmpeg installed on your system if you want to play music over voice channels.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Virtual-/JadedBot
$ cd JadedBot
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ touch configfile
```

Notice at the end we created a configfile. This is the file that will hold the settings we need in order for the bot to work properly so edit the file and input the following:

```
[JadedBot]
TOKEN = DISCORDTOKENHERE
REDDIT_ID = REDDITTOKENHERE
REDDIT_SECRET = REDDITSECRETHERE
```

If reddit functionality is not required, rename `reddit.py` in the cogs directory to `reddit.py.backup`. Checks will be put in place in the later version to run without any tokens added to the configfile.

The token entry, the top `TOKEN` is your discord API key. The following two are only necessary if you want reddit functionality. If you want that follow this [guide](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html).

Start up the program with `$ python3 jaded.py`. It's best to run this in the background somehow, there are various ways to do this on Linux/BSD systems with GNU Screen, Tmux or simply running `$ python3 jaded.py &`.

#### Windows 

##### Visual C++
First we are going to need to install Visual C++ 14.0 or greater found here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

Install this and when finished open up "Visual Studio Installer" and navigate to the "Available tab" and install "Visual Studio Build Tools 2019".

After this is installed you will then need to click "Modify" on "Visual Studio Build Tools 2019"

Under Desktop & Mobile select "C++ build tools" and on the right side under Installation details make sure the following are selected.

- MSVC v142 -VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
- Windows 10 SDK
- C++ Cmake tools for Windows
- Testing tools core features
- C++ AddressSanitizer

Once these are selected, press "modify" in the bottom right and wait for it to complete.

##### Python
Go to the python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the installer.

Run the installer which is pretty straight forward but make sure to select the "ADD PYTHON TO PATH" option or you will have issues with pip later on.

##### FFmpeg
FFmpeg is required if you want the bot to play audio files and have access to voice features on discord.

For JadedBot we need to download ffmpeg from here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z

Unzip this and rename the extracted folder to "ffmpeg" and place it in the root of C:

The .exe file of ffmpeg should be at `"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"`

##### JadedBot source
The easiest way is to download the latest source from: https://github.com/Virtual-/JadedBot/releases/

Download the source code, extract it and open the JadedBot folder.

Hold shift and right click in the folder and select "open powershell window here"

First we will install the dependencies with the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

After this command is finished we will then re-update these dependencies as they could be out of date with this command: `pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}`

Run the bot with `python jaded.py`, this will probably fail as we haven't set up the discord key in the `configfile` but this will generate the `configfile` in the directory.

Open the `configfile` and set the TOKEN variable with your discord key.

Run `python jaded.py` again and the bot should now be running.
